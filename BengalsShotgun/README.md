The Bengals offense is struggling to start the 2023 season, mainly due to Burrow's injury limiting their play diversity, with 99%+ of their plays coming from shotgun.

So how much has it actually impacted their play? An analysis of the play-by-play data of the Bengals offense and shotgun frequency across the league via @nflfastR:

The Bengals Shotgun EPA has fallen by nearly 0.3, from one of the best to one of the worst.

The Shotgun is a very effective method, but so far this year (2023 W1-4) it's seen its struggles when over-ran, for more teams then just the Bengals.

The smaller sample size of 4 games is probably indicative of game script, as teams who ran more shotgun in 2022, had a higher EPA

When looking at play continuity, the Bengals ran shotgun 3 consecutive plays 54% of the time last year, the highest average of shotgun/non-shotgun combinations at 6.4 yards per play and 0.16 EPA

However across the league, when teams ran shotgun twice then a non-shotgun play, it led to the highest EPA but lower yards gained, presuming that the two shotgun plays set up a great non-shotgun EPA play (short run for a first down, shorter TD score)

When aggregated:   

Ran Shotgun 3 in a Row: +0.022 EPA 
Non-Shotgun at least once in L3 Plays: -0.012 EPA   

A p-value of 0.05!  

The graph shows near identical densities (agnostic of play type), but displays the difference via a near exact horizontal shift between the two.
